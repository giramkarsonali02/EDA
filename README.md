# EDA

short description of each function used in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in a Jupyter Notebook:

head() – Displays the first few rows of the dataset to get a quick overview of the data.

describe() – Provides statistical summary (mean, median, std, etc.) of numerical columns.

info() – Shows dataset structure, data types, and non-null values for each column.

value_counts() – Counts unique values in a column to understand category distribution.

tail() – Displays the last few rows of the dataset to check the end values or structure.

isnull() – Identifies missing values in the dataset by returning a Boolean matrix.

countplot – Visualizes the count of observations in each categorical bin using bars.

heatmap – Shows correlation or missing data patterns using color-coded matrices.

boxplot – Visualizes data distribution and detects outliers through quartiles.

barplot – Shows average (or specified statistic) of a numeric variable across categories.

scatterplot – Plots points to show the relationship between two continuous variables.
